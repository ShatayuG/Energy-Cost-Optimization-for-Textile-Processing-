Industries, facing escalating energy demand and costs, prioritize energy conservation and optimal
utilization. Energy management is vital for profitability and competitiveness, especially in sectors
like textiles. Effective management ensures efficient resource usage, minimizing expenses and
enhancing sustainability. By adopting sound energy strategies, industries can navigate global
competition and contribute to a more sustainable energy landscape, securing their place in the
market while reducing environmental impact.
Energy management involves tracking and controlling energy and material use to achieve goals
with minimal power consumption. It includes monitoring and analyzing resource allocation,
supply, and conversion. By finding the most efficient ways to meet demands using available
resources and technologies, energy management helps reduce costs and environmental impact
over time.
Textile manufacturing is intricate due to diverse substrates, processes, and machinery. Various
yarns, fabric production methods, and finishing steps contribute to energy intensity. Energy
models aid decision-makers by offering insights into the consequences of their choices,
improving decision-making. These mathematical tools, grounded in the system approach, help
tackle complex issues. Selecting the most suitable model depends on the specific problem
decision-makers aim to address.
Linear programming finds extensive applications in business, engineering, transportation, energy,
telecommunications, and manufacturing. It's valuable for modeling planning, routing, scheduling,
assignment, and design problems. Commonly used in management for profit maximization or
cost minimization, it serves as a fundamental technique for optimization. Linear programming
involves an objective function and a set of linear constraints.
The textile manufacturing plant industrial model aims to reduce energy costs by analyzing the
production of yarn, grey fabric, and finished fabric. It considers equipment powered by
electricity, wood fuel, and fuel oil. The goal is to create mathematical models ensuring product
requirements are met while minimizing energy expenses, subject to operational constraints.
